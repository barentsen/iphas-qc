eyeballing info on fields 6500 through to 0999 (just over 2000 of them - the middle ~third)
 
to sum up on comments:
bad = heavy-cloud calibration failure (CMD/CCD off scale)
gv = gain variation (if in capitals - really severe)
sp = 'sparse', or more properly - shallow - no objects plotting below an apparent
        r mag of 20
ce = colour error - strong bell-ing out of the CMD at faint mags, even if r mags
        down to 21-22 are present (not many of these marked - a bit hard to do
        by eye rigorously)
bc = bad calibration - not actually grounds to throw out the observation - more 
        an issue for the GPC algorithm's zp values.  Have marked a bunch of fields in
        the 400s with this, that are mainly at l ~125 and b ~ -3 gie or take a
        few degrees.  Is this where there is a bigger drift wrt to APASS in i?
