IPHAS Quality Control Data
==========================

This directory contains all the bits and pieces required to create the table
'iphas-observations.fits', containing all the essential metadata and quality control 
information on observations carried out as part of the IPHAS survey.

This master table is generated using the shell script 'create-iphas-observations-table.sh', 
which collates data from the different subdirectories using TopCat/stilts.
