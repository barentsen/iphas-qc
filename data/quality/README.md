Quality classification
======================

Scripts:

* evaluate-quality.py
  Assigns quality codes A/B/C to each observation using the quality measures in iphas-observations.fits.

* best-fields.py
  Decides on the best 'run' (e.g. sep2010) for each field (e.g. 0001) based on the quality measures in iphas-observations.fits.
