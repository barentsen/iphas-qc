WEATHER CONDITIONS (eg transparancy, dust, %cloud cover, seeing):
humidity low,  but very steep rise at the end of night. maybe cirrus. variable seeing of about 2arcsec or larger

COMMENTS (causes of time lost, setup information eg CCD windows):
Time lost due to humidity. We also have problems identifying standar fields. Autoguider did not respond to commands sometimes, and that also
made me lose some time. I couldn't do twilight flights at the end of the night so I tried to do dome flats. The telesocpe didn't respond
to offsets when doing dome flats.
