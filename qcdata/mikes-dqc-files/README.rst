These scripts download, collate and summarize the "sum8" files which the CASU pipeline produces. These files are useful because they show the seeing and ellipticities for all exposures.

Note:
- Mike has separate directories for "oct2004" and "oct2004_extra" , the combined contents of which are called "iphas_oct2004" under ~eglez/newmerges.
- Mysterious "extra/" under ~mike?
